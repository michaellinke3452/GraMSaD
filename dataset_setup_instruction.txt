How to build the Segmentation (S1) and Detection (D1) datasets:
Open a Terminal in this folder (/datasets/) and copy the following commands. 




D1:
test set command:

cat D1/D1_test/D1_test.h5.* > D1/D1_test/rebuild/D1_test.h5

training set command:

cat D1/D1_train/D1_train.h5.* > D1/D1_train/rebuild/D1_train.h5


S1:
test set command:

cat S1/S1_test/S1_test.h5.* > S1/S1_test/rebuild/S1_test.h5

training set command:

cat S1/S1_train/S1_train.h5.* > S1/S1_train/rebuild/S1_train.h5


After running the commands, you can find the H5-files in the rebuild folders. 

Example for S1_train:
After running the command 
cat S1/S1_train/S1_train.h5.* > S1/S1_train/rebuild/S1_train.h5,
there should be a new file named S1_train.h5 in:

S1/S1_train/rebuild
